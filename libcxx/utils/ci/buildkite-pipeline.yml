# This file describes the various pre-commit CI bots used to test libc++.
#
# This file should never contain logic -- all the logic must be offloaded
# into scripts. This is critical to being able to reproduce CI issues outside
# of the CI environment, which is important for debugging.
#
# It is also worth noting that this script is split into several sections, the
# goal being to reduce the load on testers when a commit is known to fail.
#

# The Linux CI runners use the nightly ToT build provided by the Docker image.
# (Note the image isn't updated daily.) The LLVM_HEAD_VERSION contains that
# version number. The Linux CI runners for GCC use the latest stable version.
# Theses numbers are available in all runners, making it easier to update the
# version number.
